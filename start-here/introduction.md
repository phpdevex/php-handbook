# Introduction

Hi there :wave:

The PHP handbook is an unofficial handbook, meant to be used alongside the [official docs](https://php.net) to help you learn PHP or to act as an everyday reference if you already know it.

It's a work-in-progress. Feel free to submit issues, leave feedback or get in touch via the github link.
